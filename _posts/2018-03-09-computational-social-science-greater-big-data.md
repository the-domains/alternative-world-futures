# Computational Social Science \> Big Data

It was quite a while ago (OK, a couple of years ago) that I came across this white paper Sage had published, titled "[Who is doing computational social science][0]?". It caught my attention because _I am doing computational social science_ (CSS). Not only that, but I know quite a few people who do CSS. ...and not just _some_ people; many of **the** people. I know them because I study in the first CSS department that was organized in the United States. Together, we represent a significant chunk of the body of knowledge that can reasonably be called CSS. 

I was curious to see what Sage's white paper authors were saying about us. I was really disappointed. The Sage paper did not reference a single person from my department. It did not mention any of the "big names", the people who broke ground, or people who literally wrote the books that represent the discipline. They did cite Albert-László Barabási a lot. ...and he is definitely a key figure in the development and practice of the discipline of CSS.

I should have known that I'd be disappointed as soon as I saw the subtitle of the paper: Trends in Big Data Research. The paper was almost entirely about using big data to do social research. Big data is ~one of~ the tools that a competent computational social scientist ought to have in his or her toolbox. But, publishing a whole white paper about CSS as if _CSS=Big Data_ seems really short-sighted. There's a lot more to CSS than big data. If CSS is about anything in particular, CSS is about social complexity. 

## Big Data and Complexity

Big data, like other tools in a computational social scientist's toolbox, helps to answer questions and discover new knowledge about complex social systems. This is not the same as saying that analyzing big data is the same as analyzing complexity in social systems. To describe a social system as 'complex' is different than saying that we can describe its elements in many ways, describe the many parts of it or describe them with many details. That would be overly reductionist. Big data analysis is more appropriate to an inductive-probabilistic inquiry of social complexity; as big data can only sometimes reflect, but not explain the complexity in (of ) social systems. It can also be useful in understanding, calibrating and validating models of complex social systems. The complexity of a social system is a characterization of the system's emergent properties (or existence) that cannot be directly attributable to only its components or subsystems.

### Complex Social Systems

Complexity, as a general scientific concept and social complexity, in particular, is a simple concept that is difficult to define (though complexity science has developed several ways to test for it). In fact, Niel Johnson begins his book Simply Complexity: a clear guide to complexity theory (Johnson, 2009) with "a definition, of sorts" explains that complexity is hard to define. By the bottom of page one, he does go on to offer that "complexity science is the study of phenomena that emerge from a collection of interacting objects". Herbert Simon also declined to offer a formal definition of complex systems and instead offered a working description of such systems as "made up of a large number of parts that have many interactions. . . . \[that\] the whole is more than the sum of its parts in the weak but important pragmatic sense that, given the properties of the parts and the laws of their interaction, it is not a trivial matter to infer the properties of the whole". But, these definitions are intended to describe complexity in a wider sense; the way it relates not only to social systems, but also to physical and biological systems.

Specific to social systems, Claudio Cioffi-Revilla \[1\] (one of those "big names" in CSS, who heads the Center for Social Complexity at George Mason University and who wasn't mentioned in the Sage paper) begins to describe social complexity in anthropological terms as "the extent to which a society is governed through non-kin-based relations to authority" (Cioffi-Revilla, 2014, p. 14). Later in the book chapter, he continues the description by defining key features of social complexity: bounded-rationality, emergence, near-decomposability, modularity and hierarchy in social systems.

Each of these features is important to the definition of complexity, however, as the idea of complexity compares to big data, the properties of emergence and near-decomposability have primary importance. Emergence has already come up in Johnson's working definition of complex systems and the idea of near-decomposability is implicit in Simon's.

Robert Axtell and Joshua Epstein (two more "big names" in CSS, Epstein at NY University College and Axtel, the head of the Computational Social Science program at George Mason University) explain more about emergence, and in decided more social terms, too. They explain that "a less subjective usage of \['emergence'\] applies the term to group behaviors that are qualitatively different from the behaviors of individuals composing the group." (Axtell and Epstein, 1996, p. 35) and "\[we\] use the term 'emergent' to denote stable macroscopic patterns arising from the local interactions of agents.". The emphasis that emergence describes macroscopic patterns is noteworthy. Complexity is an attribute discoverable at the macro-level; a property of a system, not its components. Furthermore, emergence in the social system occurs because of the interactions of individuals, not just their existence in the system.

Near-decomposability is a system-level attribute as well. Though related to the idea of emergence, it is distinct. It not only means that describing a system in terms of its components we could not directly describe the component which produces the system's emergent property, but also that we could not describe the functionality of the system only in terms of operations within separate subsystems. Complex systems always have some interaction between subsystems, which may be weak but is not negligible (Simon, 1996).

### Big Data and Its Uses

The term big data commonly refers to data sets that are too large to fit in the memory of typical computer workstations and laptops, or are too unstructured to be organized with traditional relational database methods. Beyond size, the term has taken on additional meanings because some treatments and applications have become synonymous with its use. Some of these are the technologies associated with storing, retrieving and processing big data, such as Hadoop, Spark and the MapReduce algorithm that supports distributed computation on these large files. Big data is expansive and usually heterogeneous---enabling cross- and trans-disciplinary research.

Big data has also come to represent the invasion of personal privacy (real and imagined) that comes from analysis of people's 'data exhaust'. Data exhaust is the electronic history of people's purchases, likes and dislikes; the movies they watch and how they responded to them; the things they read, and so forth. Big data will record even more about people as the 'internet of things' (IoT) records even more everyday activities, using so-called 'smart' devices: [smart][1][beds][2] that track sleep patterns; semi-permanent [bio-sensors][3] that track physical activity levels, hydration, lactate uptake and blood oxygen levels; smart [cars][4] that track not only our movements but also our compliance with traffic laws; and, smart [environmental][5] sensors record the quality of the air we breathe and which pollutants are present there. The important thing here is that as the popularity of these devices grows, the amount of data collected about people and their habits will grow as well. Big data is detailed and ubiquitous, so we can expect this fertile territory to become more fertile over the next few decades.

In a 2009 opinion article on the Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data, Alon Halevy and coauthors encourage readers that ". . . we should . . . embrace complexity and make use of the best ally we have: the unreasonable effectiveness of data" (Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira, 2009). Halevy, _et al_ were talking specifically about big data analysis of large corpora of text from the web as a substitute for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The NLP we do today is loosely founded in the 1950's Cold War research. Those were early days of 'machine translation' projects, which intended to automate language translation from Russian to English, without success. As turned out to be the case, natural language follows a much more involved and complex set of rules than early computer scientists had imagined (Ettinger & Maitland-Gholson, 1990). The problem of natural language is rooted in compounding levels of grammar, syntax, semantics, lexicon and morphology; each of these being different for each spoken language. The result is that natural language cannot be calculated directly. In the 1980's and early 1990's, computer scientists attempted to resolve some of these challenges by developing topical and conceptual ontologies. Indeed, that approach continues to be useful in many ways in those sectors of the economy where the investment is (financially) worthwhile (Halevy et al., 2009). Meanwhile, computational linguistics---the branch of linguistics that is primarily concerned with machine translation, nowadays---is treated as a branch of artificial intelligence because the prospect of creating an artificial intelligence (AI) that learns multiple languages is more promising than the rule-based approach of traditional NLP.

According to Ettinger and Maitland-Gholson (1990) the renaissance for text analytics came in the late 1990's with studies of empirical patterns of language taken from large corpora of raw text \[2\]. Researchers began to look for statistical patterns in word usage; effectively changing tack: instead of trying to get the computer to understand language, they began looking for the next probable word in a series. In the computational approach to overcoming complexity of language, the computer need not understand language so long as it could predict the next word in the series, statistically. This is what Halevy, _et al_ were talking about when the proposed a big data solution to dealing with complexity in social systems. The predictive power of big data, even to the small detail of language, can be frighteningly accurate.

This is not to say that there is no longer a need for social scientists to study language. There is still research to do for understanding language as a realm of social complexity and big data does not answer those questions for us. 

### Supporting Complexity Research with Big Data

In spite of the predictive power of big data and big data analytics, neither the data nor the models have explanatory power to help us understand why a word or a turn of phrase is a good translation; only that it most likely is. As computational social scientists, we want the answers to both questions, at least. In the Manifesto of computational social science, Rosaria Conte and many others (Conte et al., 2012) affirmed that: 
> 
> On the one hand, computational social science is aimed to favor and take advantage of massive \[information and communications technologies\] data. On the other, it is a model-based science yielding both predictive and explanatory models. . . . Both objectives must be achieved to turn social science into applicable tools that can inform decision makers about issues of major concern.

To support policy making and promote social improvement, we also want to know how complex social systems work and how to influence them. Big data, expansive as it is, is most useful for predicting micro-level outcomes. Complexity emerges at the system level and is not completely decomposable, even into big data. 

\[1\] It is worth pointing out: I realize that Cioffi is using social complexity to mean a very specific instance of a complex social system, but I think the counterpoint is necessary to push the point that applications of complexity science may not be initially clear.

\[2\] This idea was originally proposed by Max Weber in 1910 (Cioffi-Revilla, 2014).
