# I'll call it GEORGE

I'm writing my dissertation research at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA. It's not a very famous school (like Harvard or Stanford or MIT), but GMU's College of Science here is a top-tier research school and is consistently ranked as one of the best values in graduate science education in the US. It's OK to be proud to be doing my research at George Mason. 

Sean Luke is the primary author of GMU's agent-based simulation toolkit, [MASON][0], a joint project between GMU's Evolutionary Computing Laboratory and the Center for Social Complexity. MASON is a, "fast, discrete-event multi-agent simulation library" written in Java, and is, "designed to be the foundation for large custom-purpose simulations". I think MASON could be a great foundation for the large simulation laboratory that I'm trying to build and it makes sense to start with a solid foundation; especially when my project comes with so many inherent risks. 

So, I've decided that the working title for my simulation project should be called GEORGE: a Generator for Experiments on the Order and Relations in a Global Environment. George goes well with MASON. This work is being done at George Mason University. ...and I feel a bit attached to the project, _a la_[Looney Tunes.][1]
