# Longer Than an Elevator Speech

Several weeks ago, George Mason University announced that it would hold a [3-Minute Thesis][0] competition. I ignored the message.

A couple weeks later, the Graduate College of Science prompted us with a reminder email and mentioned that, "it would be good" for doctoral candidates in the college to register for it. I registered.

A typical elevator speech is supposed to be 30 seconds. So, I figured that I should be able to introduce my idea, give four related elevator speeches, then conclude with time to spare. It turned out to be a little more complicated than that. (Isn't it always!)

This is what I came up with. It consistently takes me 2:50 minutes to read through it aloud. Memorizing it to the point that it pours out naturally in front of judges may take a little more time.

1. Did you know that Rome is over 2,700 years old? The beginning of Western civilization: 2,700 years old.
2. Rome wasn't even the first state-like civilization in the world. There were also Greece, Sumer (Mesopotamia), Harappa (in the Indus valley), Erlitou (in China)... State-like polities have existed for thousands of years. 
3. Through the social sciences and humanities we have a good outline of the story of social development over time and around the world. 
4. Historically, we see that significant changes in world order together with broad social change, coincide with war. War is a problem.
5. In fact, for at least the last several hundred years, the largest wars --the record-setting wars-- have gone hand-in-hand with social change and shifts in world order.
6. The statistical pattern of record-setting wars indicates that we are long over-due for the next one. In fact, we are so long overdue that we are nearly due again. 
7. Because of rapid global transportation and the advent of the internet, radical and uneven social change is already under way.
8. The world order we are familiar with: the society of \`nation-states' has existed for only a few hundred years; since the 18th century. It has not always been and likely will not always be this way. A change in world order is inevitable and it will likely coincide with the next record-setting war. 
9. So, I am developing a laboratory to simulate long-term, global social change and study alternative, future world orders. It's a way to study patterns of change, test intervention policies; and, study the effects of our collective social behaviors.
10. The core of my project is to develop a computer simulation that can support strategic thinking about complex and inter-connected global social issues.
11. The model design and its software instantiation will be modular and extensible to enable long-term evolution and to be a common basis for experiments with competing theories from the various social science disciplines.
12. Global-level simulation models like this are not new. Previous attempts have fallen short of expectations, not necessarily because the social science was under-developed but because computing power was overly-limiting. The world is really big!
13. Now, social science is more advanced. We have better simulation techniques. There has been a \`big data' revolution in computer science. These are sufficient reasons to warrant a new generation of global-scale models. I expect my simulation to be a worthwhile step forward for policy-making and social science research.
