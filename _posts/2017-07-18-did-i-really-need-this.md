I really needed this.

About a year ago, I registered for an ORCID number and posted about feeling ridiculous for doing it. This week, I finally had cause to use it and I was immediately glad to have it already.

> I just registered for an ORCID number. I don't think I really need one, not with a whopping five publications under my belt (and only one of them in an academic conference proceedings). I mean, I've got a few other things with my name on them out in the internet wilds---conference slides, an R project, things like that. It's all industrial quality or amature fun.
