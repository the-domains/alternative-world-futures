Did I really need this?

I just registered for an [ORCID][0] number. I don't think I really need one, not with a whopping five publications under my belt (and only one of them in an academic conference proceedings). I mean, I've got a few other things with my name on them out in the internet wilds---conference slides, an R project, things like that. It's all industrial quality or amature fun.
