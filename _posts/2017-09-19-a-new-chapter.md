# A New Chapter...

Sometimes I get distracted from my dissertation research. For example, I occasionally do consulting work; just to keep my professional chops. (Although, I must admit that the money is nice and consulting pays a lot better than graduate research.) The primary consulting distraction on my plate has been a fun project simulating and analyzing learning effectiveness evaluation data. Doing the work gives me a chance to extend and apply my technical skills. I work with some talented people. And, I'm learning quite a few new things about statistics. 

Anyway, one of the first [industry papers][0] our team published was selected to be included in a book geared toward U.S. Army data analysts. Lately, I've been rewriting that paper into a book chapter. Writing for a book feels different than writing for an academic or industry conference. It feels more permanent. It feels 'more serious-er', for quite a few reasons (some of which might even be valid). Again, there were things to be learned.

I was thrilled that we had the chance to switch to LaTeX to write. Once I learned to write with LaTeX, I've resisted using word processors for anything serious. A challenge here was that none of my primary co-authors had ever used LaTeX before and we really needed a good collaborative writing platform; something full-featured but, easy to use for the new initiates. I spent a few days trying out some of the online editors. [Authorea][1] stood out for ease-of-use. In the end, I fell in love with [Papeeria][2]. 

I like Papeeria so much, I'll probably switch to it as my primary LaTeX writing environment. Definitely, it's how I will try to write all future collaborative scientific papers. The big reasons:

* You can sync a Papeeria project with a Github repository
* You can invite co-authors and readers by email account or generate a magic link
* You can sync the bibliography to a Mendeley folder
* You can write with LaTeX, Markdown, or both
* You can generate plots with GNUplot or with Plot.ly and link to them within a document
* You can upload all the images, sub-documents, style sheets, packages and such that you need for a complete project your way
* It's not very expensive, even for the "pro" subscription

For example, with our book project we were given a .zip file with the book template, which has a pretty complicated structure as LaTeX projects go. Papeeria had no problems with it. That's pretty cool, IMO.

Putting a polished bibliography into a book is critical, I think. I really wanted to get the details correct. This is probably the least valid of my concerns over writing for a book compared to writing for a conference paper. Bibliographies and proper citations are important, anyway. But, if I get something wrong for a conference paper, I expect that people will be more understanding than if it's wrong in a book. I'm not talking "wrong" like, Jane wrote that paper instead of John. I mean "wrong" like, that article was published in early 2016 even if the Research Gate version of that article says it was published in late 2015\. 

So, I learned not to trust somebody else's bibliographic data when I went through it carefully. I blame the word processor more than my colleagues. Even if you use a citation manager to organize bibliographic information, once the text appears in a Word document, somebody will do a quick manual edit and the whole thing falls apart. Mendeley is great, too. It's not 100% reliable, though; and the bibtex export still has a lot to be desired. Quite a few of my hours on this book chapter went into fixing the bibliographic entries in Mendeley (getting the correct information into the database) and editing Mendeley's .bib file directly to get the correct data fields to show up. Yes, a newspaper article should be exported as @article, not @misc; the BibTex documentation says so.

Anyway, the draft chapter has been submitted to the editor (who's been great to work with and reasonably tolerant, I think) and I'm shifting my attention back to modeling the whole world. Next week, I'll probably be writing about copula functions for simulating heterogeneous data with correlated attributes.
