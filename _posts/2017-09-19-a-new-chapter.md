# A New Chapter...

Sometimes I get distracted from my dissertation research. For example, I occasionally do consulting work; just to keep my professional chops. (Although, I must admit that the money is nice and consulting pays a lot better than graduate research.) The primary consulting distraction on my plate has been a fun project simulating and analyzing learning effectiveness evaluation data. Doing the work gives me a chance to extend and apply my technical skills. I work with some talented people. And, I'm learning quite a few new things about statistics. 

Anyway, one of the first [industry papers][0] our team published was selected to be included in a book geared toward U.S. Army data analysts. Lately, I've been rewriting that paper into a book chapter. Writing for a book feels different than writing for an academic or industry conference. It feels more permanent. It feels 'more serious-er', for quite a few reasons (some of which might even be valid). Again, there were things to be learned.

I was thrilled that we had the chance to switch to LaTeX to write. Once I learned to write with LaTeX, I've resisted using word processors for anything serious. A challenge here was that none of my primary co-authors had ever used LaTeX before and we really needed a good collaborative writing platform; something full-featured but, easy to use for the new initiates. I spent a few days trying out some of the online editors. [Authorea][1] stood out for ease-of-use. In the end, I fell in love with [Papeeria][2]. 

I like Papeeria so much, I'll probably switch to it as my primary LaTeX writing environment. Definitely, it's how I will try to write all future collaborative scientific papers. The big reasons:

* You can sync a Papeeria project with a Github repository
* You can invite co-authors and readers by email account or generate a magic link
* You can sync the bibliography to a Mendeley folder
* You can write with LaTeX, Markdown, or both
* You can generate plots with GNUplot or with Plot.ly and link to them within a document
* You can upload all the images, sub-documents, style sheets, packages and such that you need for a complete project your way
* It's not very expensive, even for the "pro" subscription

For example, with our book project we were given a .zip file with the book template, which has a pretty complicated structure as LaTeX projects go. Papeeria had no problems with it. That's pretty cool, IMO.
