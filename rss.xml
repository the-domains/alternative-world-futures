            <description><![CDATA[<p>I created a simple model of world order developing. It's too basic to prove anything and there is no underlying data. However, it is useful as a demonstration of a few concepts that are foundational to the rest of my research project. In fact, this might better be described as an animated diagram of how ideas relate to each other.</p>,<p>This simulation is an adaptation of Cioffi-Revilla's 'canonical theory' of (origins and development of) social complexity [1]. It is a model of the process of organization in the world system, rather than being a model of countries or institutions or wars. Anybody can examine the code and experiment with the simulation by downloading the<em><a href="https://github.com/usuallycwdillon/simple-world-order/tree/master/net-logo-world-order"> .nlogo</a></em> file from my simple-world-systems repository on GitHub.</p>]]></description>
